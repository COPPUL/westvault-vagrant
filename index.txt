    interact with LOCKSS. The accounts will be created in the daemons. 
Log into the virtual machine by running "vagrant ssh".
Change to the directory where LOCKSS-O-Matic is installed: "cd /var/www/lockssomatic".
Import the WestVault LOCKSS plugin: "./app/console lom:import:plugin /vagrant/lockss/WestVaultPlugin.jar".
Create a new Content Provider in the LOCKSS menu. Use this information

	- IP Address: 127.0.0.1
	- LOCKSS Port: 9721
	- LOCKSS UI Port: 8081

Add three more using the same info as the first one with these port numbers:
	LOCKSS ports 	9722 9723 9724. 
	LOCKSS UI ports 8082 8083 8084.	

Visit the PLN details page from the Networks menu -> Your network name
Upload the public keystore by clicking on the Keystore button. Upload the 
file lockss/mjoyce.keystore from the vagrant repository.

Visit the PLN details page from the Networks menu -> Your network name

Finished configuring LOCKSSOMatic! Good time for ice cream.

Sign in to OwnCloud and agree to the terms of use.
    
http://localhost:8181/owncloud

Sign in with mark / mark.
Go to the WestVault app in the top left menu. 
Visit the settings page.
Refresh the Terms of Use.
Tick the agreement checkbox and save agreement.

Now whitelist your UUID in the staging server.

http://localhost:8181/westvaultpln/web/login

Sign in with your credentials (admin@example.com / admin).
Find yourself in the list of providers.
Copy your UUID
Go to the Providers Whitelist page
Create a new whitelist entry with your copied UUID.

Now you can send deposits from OwnCloud to the staging server.

Return to the OwnCloud app Settings page. Scroll down and click on Save Settings.
Go to the OwnCloud files page - there should be lockss-preserved and lockss-restored
folders.
Open the lockss-preserved folder and drag/drop files into it.
Go back to the WestVault app, and see the files listed. They have no status information
because they haven't been deposited yet.

Log into the virtual machine by running "vagrant ssh".
Do a vagrant ssh to get into the box and then run some commands.

Send the deposit notifications to the staging server:

cd /var/www/owncloud
sudo -u www-data ./occ westvault:deposit
sudo -u www-data ./occ westvault:status

Tell the staging server to process the deposits and send them to Lockssomatic.

cd /var/www/westvaultpln
./app/console pln:run-all -vv

Write the LOCKSSOmatic configuration files

cd /var/www/lockssomatic
sudo ./app/console lom:export:configs

Start up the LOCKSS four-box test framework. It takes a while.

cd /var/www/lockss-daemon
cd test/framework/run_multiple_daemons
./doall clean -fg -all
./start

While the LOCKSS boxes are starting, check the deposit statuses in the staging server.

cd /var/www/westvaultpln
./app/console pln:status --all -vv [--all is not valid....]

While the LOCKSS boxes are still starting, check the deposit statuses in OwnCloud.

cd /var/www/owncloud
sudo -u www-data ./occ westvault:status

Return to the OwnCloud WestVault page and see that the deposit statuses are updated.

Now that the daemon has started, visit the LOCKSS admin pages and subscribe to the AUs. Login with lockss-u / lockss-p:

http://localhost:8081
http://localhost:8082
http://localhost:8083
http://localhost:8084

Wait. Beer is good here.

Once the content has been harvested, check the deposit statuses in LOCKSSOMatic

cd /var/www/lockssomatic
./app/console lom:deposit:status

Check the deposit statuses in the staging server.

cd /var/www/westvaultpln
./app/console pln:status --all -vv

Check the deposit statuses in OwnCloud.

cd /var/www/owncloud
sudo -u www-data ./occ westvault:status

Return to the OwnCloud WestVault page and see that the deposit statuses are in Agreement.
